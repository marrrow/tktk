        <h2>Why AI Music Deserves a Place in Your TikTok Strategy</h2>
        <p>The days of spending hours searching for the perfect copyright-free track are over. AI music generators can now create custom beats, melodies, and full tracks tailored to your content needs in minutes. But the benefits go far beyond time savings:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Uniqueness Factor:</strong> Unlike trending sounds used by thousands, AI-generated music gives your content a distinctive audio signature.</li>
          <li><strong>Algorithm Advantage:</strong> TikTok’s algorithm favors content with unique audio, potentially boosting discoverability.</li>
          <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Need a beat that builds up precisely with your video’s transition? AI music can be tailored exactly to your pacing and mood.</li>
          <li><strong>Copyright Freedom:</strong> No worries about takedowns or attribution—you own what you create.</li>
        </ul>
